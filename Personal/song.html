    <p>
Hush, The little child is sleeping, <br>
Sweet baby born tonight.<br>
Laid in a manger safe keeping,<br>
While a star above shines bright.<br>
    </p>

        <p>
            Mary and Joseph are happy,<br>
            Their child is here at last.<br>
            His birth to them a miracle,<br>
            Foretold by prophets past.<br>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="lyrics3">
        <p>
            While the animals move softly<br>
            The babe sleeps undisturbed.<br>
            Angels o're the hillside are singing,<br> 
            And shepherds hear their words.<br>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="lyrics4">
        <p>
            Worship the child and glory to God, <br>
            For this king and Savior new.<br>
            This boy child in the manger asleep<br>
            Is born for each of you.<br>
        </p>
    </section>
    <sections class="lyrics5">
        <p>
            And the shepherds go and find him<br>
            And on their knees they pray, <br>
            Father in Heaven we thank <br>
            For this great and glorious day.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Wisemen also seek Him,<br>
            Following that star above.<br>
            Gifts they lay before Him,<br>
            Bowing to that child of love.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Christ was born that Christmas day,<br>
            A mission of love to show us the way.<br>
            Praise His name forever more, <br>
            Jesus, the Christ, Whom we adore.<br>
