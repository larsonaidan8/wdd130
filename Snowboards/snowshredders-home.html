                This company has changed the dynamics of snowboarding. We make elite boards for everyone to enjoy. However unlike most companies we make our snowboards very different.
                Our snowboards are made from recycling other snowboards. We get snowboards that are old and retired or broken and we use them to create whole new snowboards that can be used
                all over again. If you would like you can ship your personal snowboard to us or select one of our prepurchased snowboards and choose the design that you like best. These snowboards are meant to be able to be used for all kinds of things and all kinds of people.
                We have such a wide variety of snowboard that our company sells. We sell everything from begginer snowboards for little kids all the way up to expert level boards that can be custom designed for professionals.
                When you purchase our recycled snowboards or any of our products we donate 15% of the profit to charity. 
                If you have an old snowboard you can ship it to us and we will pay you. Prices may differ depending on size 
                and conditions of snowboards.
