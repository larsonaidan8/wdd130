        This company has changed the dynamics of snowboarding. We make elite boards for everyone to enjoy. However unlike most companies we make our snowboards very different.
        Our snowboards are made from recycling other snowboards. We get snowboards that are old and retired or broken and we use them to create whole new snowboards that can be used
        all over again. These snowboards are meant to be able to be used for all kinds of things and all kinds of people.
        We have such a wide variety of snowboard that our company sells. We sell everything from begginer snowboards for little kids all the way up to expert level boards that can be custom designed for professionals.

      <h3>Models (page2) </h3>
      <p>
        We have many different models that are available for sale. We have all kinds of different sizes and shapes depending on what you want to do with you snowboard. 
        Different shaped snowboards serve different purposes and allow you to more easily focus on something and be able to do what you want more efficiently.
        We have more affordable optinos for those who don't want to make a huge investment. Then we also have more expensive versions that are rated better for tricks and more intense snowboarding, they also provide better quality 
        and longer life span. We make all of our snowboards to the best quality that we can make it for the price that we are selling them for along with the needs of each individual board.
